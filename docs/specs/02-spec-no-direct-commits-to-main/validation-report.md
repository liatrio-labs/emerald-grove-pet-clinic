## Unit 1: Pre-commit Hook Implementation

### Functional Requirements (Unit 1)

| # | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Hook entry in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with `id: no-direct-commits-to-main` | PASS | `.pre-commit-config.yaml:78` |
| 1.2 | Hook detects branch name using `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD` | PASS | `.pre-commit-config.yaml:82` -- uses `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>/dev/null` |
| 1.3 | Hook exits non-zero with error message on `main` branch | PASS | Test script: "Hook exits non-zero (1) on main branch" + "Hook displays error message about direct commits to main" |
| 1.4 | Hook exits 0 on any branch other than `main` | PASS | Test script: "Hook exits 0 on feature branch" + "Hook produces no error output on feature branch" |
| 1.5 | Hook handles detached HEAD gracefully (allows commit) | PASS | Test script: "Hook exits 0 in detached HEAD state" + "Hook produces no error output in detached HEAD" |
| 1.6 | Hook has `always_run: true` and `pass_filenames: false` | PASS | `.pre-commit-config.yaml:88-89` confirmed; test script also validates these fields |
| 1.7 | Hook uses `language: system` | PASS | `.pre-commit-config.yaml:87` confirmed; test script validates this field |
| 1.8 | Hook entry in existing `repo: local` section alongside Maven-compile-check | PASS | `.pre-commit-config.yaml:69-90` -- both hooks under same `repo: local` block |

### Proof Artifacts (Unit 1)

| # | Artifact | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1.1 | CLI: commit on `main` shows error and is rejected | PASS | Test script Test 1: exit code 1 + error message verified |
| P1.2 | CLI: commit on feature branch succeeds (hook passes) | PASS | Test script Test 2: exit code 0, no output |
| P1.3 | File diff: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` shows new hook in `repo: local` | PASS | `git diff 2954b31..HEAD -- .pre-commit-config.yaml` confirms 13 new lines in correct location |

---

## Unit 2: Documentation Update

### Functional Requirements (Unit 2)

| # | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Description in "Available Hooks" section under "Branch Protection" subsection | PASS | `docs/PRECOMMIT.md:59-61` -- "### Branch Protection" subsection with hook listed |
| 2.2 | Documentation explains why the hook exists (enforcing PR-based workflow) | PASS | `docs/PRECOMMIT.md:145-149` -- explains PR-based workflow enforcement |
| 2.3 | Documentation notes `--no-verify` can bypass in exceptional cases | PASS | `docs/PRECOMMIT.md:167-173` -- documents `--no-verify` flag with code example |
| 2.4 | Consistent with existing documentation style and formatting | PASS | Uses same heading hierarchy, code blocks, bold labels, and prose style as existing sections |

### Proof Artifacts (Unit 2)

| # | Artifact | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2.1 | File diff: `docs/PRECOMMIT.md` shows new documentation section | PASS | `git diff 2954b31..HEAD -- docs/PRECOMMIT.md` confirms +36 lines with Branch Protection subsection and Hook Details section |
| P2.2 | Markdown lint passes | PASS | `pre-commit run markdownlint --files docs/PRECOMMIT.md` -- "Passed" |

---

## Non-Goals Compliance

| Non-Goal | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| No server-side branch protection added | PASS | No GitHub branch protection changes |
| Only `main` protected (not `master`, `develop`, etc.) | PASS | Hook checks `"$BRANCH" = "main"` only |
| No custom bypass mechanism | PASS | No env vars or config-based bypass; relies on standard `--no-verify` |
| Pre-commit hook only (not pre-push) | PASS | No `stages` field; inherits `default_stages: [pre-commit]` |
| No CI config changes | PASS | `ci:` section in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` unchanged |

---

## Repository Standards Compliance

| Standard | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hook fields match `maven-compile-check` style (`id`, `name`, `entry`, `language`, `pass_filenames`, `description`) | PASS | All fields present and consistent |
| Documentation follows existing `docs/PRECOMMIT.md` style | PASS | Heading hierarchy, code blocks, prose style all consistent |
| Markdown linting passes | PASS | markdownlint with `.markdownlint.yaml` config passes |
| Conventional commits used | PASS | `feat:` (1af66c6) and `docs:` (d51e6dc) |
